# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
We began by analyzing Kickstarter Campaign data to uncover trends and generate insights into how different factors influence campaign outcomes. These findings will be presented using charts and graphs to provide our client, Louise, with essential information at a glance. Visualizations aid in uncovering a link or trend within a dataset, but depict the findings in a simple, user-friendly way.
