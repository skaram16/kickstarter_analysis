# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
I began by analyzing Kickstarter Campaign data to uncover trends and generate insights into how different factors influence campaign outcomes. These findings were presented using charts and graphs to provide my client, Louise, with essential information at a glance. Visualizations aid in uncovering a link or trend within a dataset, but depict the findings in a simple, user-friendly way.

## Objective
To provide visual feedback to Louise that will help her establish a realistic goal, timeline, and location for her Kickstarter campaign, so that her upcoming play Fever, can be successful.
