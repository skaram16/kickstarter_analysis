# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
I began by analyzing Kickstarter Campaign data to uncover trends and generate insights into how different factors influence campaign outcomes. These findings were presented using charts and graphs to provide my client, Louise, with essential information at a glance. Visualizations aid in uncovering a link or trend within a dataset, but depict the findings in a simple, user-friendly way.

## Objective
To provide visual feedback to Louise that will help her establish a realistic goal, timeline, and location for her Kickstarter campaign, so that her upcoming play Fever, can be successful.
### FIGURE 1:
![Figure 1. All Category Outcomes-United States](https://github.com/skaram16/kickstarter_analysis/blob/main/Parent%20Category%20Comparisions.png)
Figure 1 shows us that out of all the categories in the United States, Kickstarter campaigns for "THEATER" have had the most success. This is a positive discovery for Louise and her play, *Fever*, as we are doing a campaign that has seen positive results and feedback from past campaigns.
### FIGURE 2:
![Figure 2. Subcategory Outcomes-United States](https://github.com/skaram16/kickstarter_analysis/blob/main/Subcategory%20Outcomes.png)
Figure 2 shows more detail on the subcategory outcome of "THEATER" and its' related values for Kickstarter campaigns for "PLAYS" in the United States.

The Descriptive Statistics tab, found in [Kickstarter Analysis](https://github.com/skaram16/kickstarter_analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter.xlsx), holds even more helpful information for Louise and her campaign preparation. The data tells us a couple things:
- Failed campaigns have much higher goals than successful campaigns do.
- Louise is asking for more than twice the average successful goal, which is not a good way to start this campaign.

ALthough Plays have been the most successful over the observed timeframe, Louise needs to look into more information to better determine her plan for success for the play. The "Challenge" section below will utilize this data to determine if other Kickstarter campaigns were able to come close to their fundrasing goal in a short amount of time, as Louise's play,*Fever*, did.
