# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
I began by analyzing Kickstarter Campaign data to uncover trends and generate insights into how different factors influence campaign outcomes. These findings were presented using charts and graphs to provide my client, Louise, with essential information at a glance. Visualizations aid in uncovering a link or trend within a dataset, but depict the findings in a simple, user-friendly way.

## Objective
To provide visual feedback to Louise that will help her establish a realistic goal, timeline, and location for her Kickstarter campaign, so that her upcoming play Fever, can be successful.
### FIGURE 1:
![Figure 1. All Category Outcomes-United States](https://github.com/skaram16/kickstarter_analysis/blob/main/Parent%20Category%20Comparisions.png)
Figure 1 shows us that out of all the categories in the United States, Kickstarter campaigns for "THEATER" have had the most success. This is a positive discovery for Louise and her play, *Fever*, as we are doing a campaign that has seen positive results and feedback from past campaigns.
### FIGURE 2:
![Figure 2. Subcategory Outcomes-United States](https://github.com/skaram16/kickstarter_analysis/blob/main/Subcategory%20Outcomes.png)
Figure 2 shows more detail on the subcategory outcome of "THEATER" and its' related values for Kickstarter campaigns for "PLAYS" in the United States.

The Descriptive Statistics tab, found in [Kickstarter Analysis](https://github.com/skaram16/kickstarter_analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter.xlsx), holds even more helpful information for Louise and her campaign preparation. The data tells us a couple things:
- Failed campaigns have much higher goals than successful campaigns do.
- Louise is asking for more than twice the average successful goal, which is not a good way to start this campaign.

Although "PLAYS" have been the most successful over the observed timeframe, Louise needs to look into more information to better determine her plan for success for the play. The section below will utilize the data to determine if other Kickstarter campaigns were able to come close to their fundrasing goal in a short amount of time, as Louise's play, *Fever*, did and if they were successful.


## Challenge

To determine if other Kickstarter campaigns were able to come close to their fundrasing goals in a short amount of time, the two main factors that I analyzed were:

  1. Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  2. Outcomes Based on Goals
  
The line graph below shows a few important factors that will help Louise in her campaign: 
  * The length of the campaign and its' launch date do play a critical role in campaign success.
    - May and June are the two best months to launch
    - December is the worst month for launch

Louise was also looking to musicals in Europe. The blox plot below is includes helpful information for Louise for her next endeavor.

 * The takeaway from the box and whisker plot was proof that failed kickstarters were unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money by looking at the mean and median pledged amounts and how much lower they were to the actual successful pledges.
 * Louise should try to start the play by producing it for less than the 4,000 Euro because more than half of the campaigns that were successful had goals that were less than 2,000 Euro.



## Limitations Of The Data

  * The data that was being analyzed in the 1st sheet ("Kickstarter") is from the years 2014-2016. So that we could have a clearer and better understanding and ability to have more accurate information for Louise, data from more current/recent years should be used.

  *  To have a more detailed and "better" analysis, we should ask her how long does she plan to have the play running or does she want to keep her campaign live.

  *  By looking more into the backers and how many of them are still active or if they donated specifically for Louise's interests and location would be really important for a more concise analysis.
